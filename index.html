         About Slice Cake

       <details>
        
        Slice cake became popular in the early 1900s when bakers began cutting whole cakes into individual portions for easier serving.
        As cafés and bakeries expanded, sliced cakes allowed people to enjoy different flavors without buying an entire cake.
        After World War II, improved kitchen appliances and affordable ingredients helped slice cake spread into homes and celebrations.
        By the late 20th century, layered and cream-filled slice cakes gained worldwide popularity across many cultures.
        Today, slice cake is enjoyed globally and represents convenience, sharing, and creativity in modern baking.
